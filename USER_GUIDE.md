# CrossPoint User Guide

Welcome to the **CrossPoint** firmware. This guide outlines the hardware controls, navigation, and reading features of 
the device.

## 1. Hardware Overview

The device utilises the standard buttons on the Xtink X4 in the same layout:

### Button Layout
| Location        | Buttons                                    |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Bottom Edge** | **Back**, **Confirm**, **Left**, **Right** |
| **Right Side**  | **Power**, **Volume Up**, **Volume Down**  |

---

## 2. Power & Startup

### Power On / Off

To turn the device on or off, **press and hold the Power button for half a second**. In **Settings** you can configure
the power button to trigger on a short press instead of a long one.

### First Launch

Upon turning the device on for the first time, you will be placed on the **Home** screen.

> **Note:** On subsequent restarts, the firmware will automatically reopen the last book you were reading.

---

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Home Screen

The Home Screen is the main entry point to the firmware. From here you can navigate to the **Book Selection** screen,
**Settings** screen, or **File Upload** screen.

### 3.2 Book Selection (Read)

The Book Selection acts as a folder and file browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up 
  and down through folders and books.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book.

### 3.3 Reading Screen

See [4. Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.4 File Upload Screen

The File Upload screen allows you to upload new e-books to the device. When you enter the screen you'll be prompted with
a WiFi selection dialog and then your X4 will start hosting a web server.

See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for more information on how to connect to the web server and upload files.

### 3.5 Settings

The Settings screen allows you to configure the device's behavior. There are a few settings you can adjust:
- **Sleep Screen**: Which sleep screen to display when the device sleeps, options are:
  - "Dark" (default) - The default dark sleep screen
  - "Light" - The same default sleep screen, on a white background
  - "Custom" - Custom images from the SD card, see [3.6 Sleep Screen](#36-sleep-screen) below for more information
  - "Cover" - The book cover image (Note: this is experimental and may not work as expected)
- **Status Bar**: Configure the status bar displayed while reading, options are:
  - "None" - No status bar
  - "No Progress" - Show status bar without reading progress
  - "Full" - Show status bar with reading progress
- **Extra Paragraph Spacing**: If enabled, vertical space will be added between paragraphs in the book, if disabled,
  paragraphs will not have vertical space between them, but will have first word indentation.
- **Short Power Button Click**: Whether to trigger the power button on a short press or a long press.
- **Reading Orientation**: Set the screen orientation for reading, options are:
  - "Portrait" (default) - Standard portrait orientation
  - "Landscape CW" - Landscape, rotated clockwise
  - "Inverted" - Portrait, upside down
  - "Landscape CCW" - Landscape, rotated counter-clockwise
- **Front Button Layout**: Configure the order of the bottom edge buttons, options are:
  - "Bck, Cnfrm, Lft, Rght" (default) - Back, Confirm, Left, Right
  - "Lft, Rght, Bck, Cnfrm" - Left, Right, Back, Confirm
  - "Lft, Bck, Cnfrm, Rght" - Left, Back, Confirm, Right
- **Side Button Layout**: Swap the order of the volume buttons from Previous/Next to Next/Previous. This change is only in effect when reading.
- **Reader Font Family**: Choose the font used for reading, options are:
  - "Bookerly" (default) - Amazon's reading font
  - "Noto Sans" - Google's sans-serif font
  - "Open Dyslexic" - Font designed for readers with dyslexia
- **Reader Font Size**: Adjust the text size for reading, options are "Small", "Medium", "Large", or "X Large".
- **Reader Line Spacing**: Adjust the spacing between lines, options are "Tight", "Normal", or "Wide".
- **Check for updates**: Check for firmware updates over WiFi.

### 3.6 Sleep Screen

You can customize the sleep screen by placing custom images in specific locations on the SD card:

- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory.
- **Multiple Images:** Create a `sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images
  inside. If images are found in this directory, they will take priority over the `sleep.png` file, and one will be
  randomly selected each time the device sleeps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the **Sleep Screen** setting to **Custom** in order to use these images.

> [!TIP]
> For best results:
> - Use uncompressed BMP files with 24-bit color depth
> - Use a resolution of 480x800 pixels to match the device's screen resolution.
